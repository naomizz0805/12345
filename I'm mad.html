                  I was happy because it was uncommon. 
                                 
               But later she asked if this would pay for the errands I ran for her. 
                                   
           This shut me down and I didn’t know what to do.
                                              
      I wanted to be in a good mood and shake it off but I couldn’t. 
                                
              I was<a href="Scared.html" > mad</a> at her because the only time she wanted to 
                                   
            do anything for me was for her self-interest. 
                    
              Reflecting, I wish I could’ve said something at the moment 
                 
                    and not had to hide how I felt.
